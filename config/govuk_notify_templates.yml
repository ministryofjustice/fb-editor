# Notify Service Configuration
#
# We have three different Notify environments: "live", "test" and "local".
# The Notify environment is determined by the value of the environment
# variable 'PLATFORM_ENV'.
#
# The Notify API key, set by 'GOVUK_NOTIFY_API_KEY', must correspond
# to the Notify Service of the template set used by the environment.
