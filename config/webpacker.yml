This application previously used webpacker. The project has been migrated to
jsbundling-rails (esbuild). The old `webpacker.yml` is intentionally left as a
placeholder to document the migration; it is not used at runtime.

Run `yarn build` to compile JavaScript, or `yarn build:watch` for a watcher.
